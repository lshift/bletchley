SPKI Suite B cryptography
=========================

NSA Suite B Cryptography <http://enwp.org/NSA_Suite_B_Cryptography> is a suite
of cryptographic primitives endorsed by the NSA for protecting US Government
data.  However, it does not mandate a serialization format for cryptographic
information.  SPKI Suite B combines those components of Suite B authorised for
protecting TOP SECRET classified information with a simple serialization format
drawn from the SPKI standard to provide a modular, extensible solution for
message encryption and signing in Java.
