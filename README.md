# Bletchley: a small, versatile public key encryption library

Bletchley is an attempt to simplify writing bespoke cloud based applications 
which process sensitive data according to the principal of least privilege. 
It provides end to end encryption of data using public key encryption as
described by NSA Suite B for top secret classified material. It enables
architects to minimise the security risks inherent in these systems.

Bletchley is implemented for Java currently, but the message format is
language agnostic, and ports to other languages are planned.
