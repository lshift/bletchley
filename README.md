# Bletchley: a small, versatile public key encryption library

Bletchley is an attempt to simplify writing bespoke cloud based applications 
which process sensitive data according to the principal of least privilege. 
It provides end to end encryption of data using public key encryption as
described by NSA Suite B for top secret classified material. It enables
architects to minimise the security risks inherent in these systems.

## Roadmap

Bletchley is implemented for Java currently, and considering porting it
to other languages has pointed out some issues. Some parts of it are
subject to significant change. See the [roadmap](doc/roadmap.md)
